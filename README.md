# ocean-py
Python data science routines developed with Anaconda.

The goals of these "package" are process, analyze, and present oceanographic data.

It is important to state that the scripts were developed for my specific demands regarding my Ph.D. in physical oceanography, without the use of coding best practices, and can be used as a starting point for similar issues.
